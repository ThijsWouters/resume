# UMMS

UMMS is used to generate test letters and then to send them. Thus it
can be calculated how long it takes to send a letter from country to
another country a letter. In UMMS this is done by first loading
a model to calculate what kind of letter should be sent. To send the
letters we need panelists, these can be recruited from UMMS. These
letters are then sent to the panel members so that they can continue
to send others. When a panelist sends or receives a letter, he must
enter the date and additional data into UMMS.

For the front end we use Spring MVC and Twitter Bootstrap. Hibernate
is the back-end. Everything is held together by Spring. We develop
all test-first, first by a simple unit testing and then everything
with Selenium in the browser. To keep the project on the right path
we follow the Scrum methodology.
