# FedEx Web Client

This is a web application where customers can enter the information
of their packages so they can be shipped from the warehouse or that
they can be picked up to be further processed.

If the packet is sent, the customer can track its package in
a tracking tool that is built into the web client.

There is also a connection to the backend systems to generate a label
if the customer needs this. This happens, depending on the backend,
with a web service or a socket connection.

Apart from these features, the customer can also check his stock in
the warehouse of FedEx.
