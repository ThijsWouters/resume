### Period

UMMS is used to generate test letters and then to send them. Thus it
can be calculated how long it takes to send a letter from country to
another country a letter. In UMMS this is done by first loading
a model to calculate what kind of letter should be sent. To send the
letters we need panelists, these can be recruited from UMMS. These
letters are then sent to the panel members so that they can continue
to send others. When a panelist sends or receives a letter, he must
enter the date and additional data into UMMS.

For the front end we use Spring MVC and Twitter Bootstrap. Hibernate
is the back-end. Everything is held together by Spring. We develop
all test-first, first by a simple unit testing and then everything
with Selenium in the browser. To keep the project on the right path
we follow the Scrum methodology.

Transform and Validate XML module

### Client

LCM

### Period

December 2011 - January 2012

### Description

This module is used to convert various data formats to other formats
and to validate the data. For the end user it needed to be easy to do
this in one call. For this I have developed a mechanism that reads
a configuration file and then you can easily call the translator.
I created the framework to call the translator. And a translator that
can do a number of actions to a file. These actions can have an xslt
transformation, an XSD validation or others. Another example is to
use a translator that can read and translate a huge file without too
much memory. Finally, I also developed a XMLReader that can read
a CSV file as an XML.

I have worked more on the front end. The user enters his data, they
are validated with the FormValidator class from MooTools. After which
they are sent through Spring Web Services to the backend.

There are a number of views possible to display the data. First,
there is the plain HTML view, this is based on Struts and Tiles for
the layout and FreeMarker to generate certain recurring items. Then
there is the XML view, which is extracted from the backend. Finally
there is the pdf view, which is based on FOP. With xslt the xml is
transformed into an xml from which FOP generates the PDF.
